# Hello! 👋

## Welcome to the Reci Org

Reci is a social recipe-sharing app where users can post recipes, review what they’ve cooked, and follow friends to stay updated on what’s hot in their kitchens.

## Status

We are currently working on a re-write of Reci, which we will deploy so that everyone can have a taste of some of the awesome things we've been cooking. We are passionate about what we're building, and cannot wait to share it with you!
